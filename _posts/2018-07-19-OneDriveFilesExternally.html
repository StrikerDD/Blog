<p>Sharing files outside of your orginization was always a headache. One of the biggest headaches was ensuring the files were secure as well as ensuring the files can not be manipulated. Fear no more, OneDrive is here to HELP!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why use OneDrive to share files Externally?</h2>

<p>Safe, Secure, and Included with Office 365 business and enterprise plans!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Makes Sharing OneDrive files externally so Secure?</h2>

<p>Great question! Below is an example of the secure settings you can set!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Secure Settings</h2>

<p>As you can see above, the options for sharing are pretty straight forward. The "Anyone" selection will give anyone the ability to access it once shared. This includes internally and externally. Additonal options include setting an expiration date as well as marking the document as a read only document by unchecking the "Allow Editing"</p>

<p>For more granular sharing, you can select "Specific People" on the sharing screen. This option does not allow you to put an expiration date but it does allow you to disable editing.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why is this important?</h2>

<p>Over the many years of being in technology, it has always come up from end users to be able to share documents externally. This allows orginizations to utilize the many features of their Office 365 suite securely and without any additonal costs.</p>
